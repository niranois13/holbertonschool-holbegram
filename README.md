# Holbegram

This repository contains all needed files for ![Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/)'s project **Holbegram**.

During this project, I will build a clone of ![Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) as a mobile app.

## Tech Stack:

To complete this project, I have to use both ![Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), ![Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and ![Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

__Firebase__ will allow me to build an Android backend (as I am an Android user), with a email/password login method and the needed database.
__Cloudinary__ will be used to store and manipulate images and videos from their cloud services.
__Flutter__ will allow me to build a _back-end agnostic_ frond-end as it is a Dart language framework.
